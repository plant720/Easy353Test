# Easy353Test
This github repository is used to store test data and results for Easy353.

* `Glycine_max`: A test data for users to recover AGS with Easy353.
* `Oryza_sativa`: Files are used to test the accuracy of Easy353â€™s results.
* `comparision`: A comparison on the outcomes (data matrices and phylogenetic outcomes based on sequences from empirical studies) between Easy353 and HybPiper, which includes the recovered sequences, data matrices and phylogenetic trees. 

The contents of `Oryza_sativa` and `comparision` can be used to reproduce the results in the paper: *Easy353: A tool to get Angiosperms353 genes for phylogenomic research*.
